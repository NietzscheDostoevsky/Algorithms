Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

Percolation. 
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: 
    what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? 
    Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), 
    under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? 
    Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

The model. 
We model a percolation system using an n-by-n grid of sites. 
    Each site is either open or blocked. 
    A full site is an open site that can be connected to an open site 
    in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites. 
    We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. 
    In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open sites connected 
    to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row. 
    (For the insulating/metallic materials example, the open sites correspond to metallic materials, 
    so that a system that percolates has a metallic path from top to bottom, with full sites conducting. 
    For the porous substance example, the open sites correspond to empty space through which water might flow, 
    so that a system that percolates lets water fill open sites, flowing from top to bottom.)

The problem. 
In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: 
    if sites are independently set to be open with probability p 
    (and therefore blocked with probability 1 − p), 
    what is the probability that the system percolates? 
    When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; 
    when p equals 1, the system percolates. 
    The plots below show the site vacancy probability p versus the percolation probability 
    for 20-by-20 random grid (left) and 100-by-100 random grid (right).

When n is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value p* 
    such that when p < p* a random n-by-n grid almost never percolates, 
    and when p > p*, a random n-by-n grid almost always percolates. 
    No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold p* has yet been derived. 
    Your task is to write a computer program to estimate p*.

Percolation data type. To model a percolation system, create a data type Percolation with the following API:

public class Percolation {

    // creates n-by-n grid, with all sites initially blocked
    public Percolation(int n)

    // opens the site (row, col) if it is not open already
    public void open(int row, int col)

    // is the site (row, col) open?
    public boolean isOpen(int row, int col)

    // is the site (row, col) full?
    public boolean isFull(int row, int col)

    // returns the number of open sites
    public int numberOfOpenSites()

    // does the system percolate?
    public boolean percolates()

    // test client (optional)
    public static void main(String[] args)
}

Corner cases.  
By convention, the row and column indices are integers between 1 and n, where (1, 1) is the upper-left site: 
    Throw an IllegalArgumentException if any argument to open(), isOpen(), or isFull() is outside its prescribed range. 
    Throw an IllegalArgumentException in the constructor if n ≤ 0.

Performance requirements.  
The constructor must take time proportional to n2; 
    all instance methods must take constant time plus a constant number of calls to union() and find().

To perform a series of computational experiments, create a data type PercolationStats with the following API.

public class PercolationStats {

    // perform independent trials on an n-by-n grid
    public PercolationStats(int n, int trials)

    // sample mean of percolation threshold
    public double mean()

    // sample standard deviation of percolation threshold
    public double stddev()

    // low endpoint of 95% confidence interval
    public double confidenceLo()

    // high endpoint of 95% confidence interval
    public double confidenceHi()

   // test client (see below)
   public static void main(String[] args)

}

Throw an IllegalArgumentException in the constructor if either n ≤ 0 or trials ≤ 0.
Also, include a main() method that takes two command-line arguments n and T, 
    performs T independent computational experiments (discussed above) on an n-by-n grid, 
    and prints the sample mean, sample standard deviation, 
    and the 95% confidence interval for the percolation threshold.

Analysis of running time and memory usage (optional and not graded). Implement the Percolation data type using the quick find algorithm in QuickFindUF.

Use Stopwatch to measure the total running time of PercolationStats for various values of n and T. How does doubling n affect the total running time? 
    How does doubling T affect the total running time? Give a formula 
    (using tilde notation) of the total running time on your computer (in seconds) as a single function of both n and T.
Using the 64-bit memory-cost model from lecture, 
    give the total memory usage in bytes (using tilde notation) 
    that a Percolation object uses to model an n-by-n percolation system. 
    Count all memory that is used, including memory for the union–find data structure.
Now, implement the Percolation data type using the weighted quick union algorithm in WeightedQuickUnionUF. 
Answer the questions in the previous paragraph.

1.1.15 Write a static method histogram() that takes
an array a[] of int values and
an integer M as arguments and returns 
an array of length M whose ith entry is 
the number of times the integer i appeared in the argument array. 
If the values in a[] are all between 0 and M–1, 
the sum of the values in the returned array should be 
equal to a.length.

# Sorting algorithms

This would contain sorting algorithms from the book 
##Algorithms by Sedgewick, 4th Ed

The code contained in that book is in Java, and I am converting those files into python implementation. 

It is a line by line conversion, instead of using Python's inbuilt methods/libraries. Logically all the code would be same.
